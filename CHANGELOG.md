# Change Log

## [v0.4.1](https://github.com/ValeLint/vale/tree/v0.4.1) (2017-04-18)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ValeLint/vale/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1)

This release includes experimental support for a `spelling` extension point:

```yaml
extends: spelling
message: "Use '%s' instead of '%s'"
level: error
scope: text.md
# "US", "UK" or omit to ignore locality differences
locale: US
ignore: # You can remove words to the default dictionary
  - Something
add: # You can add words to the default dictionary
  - Valelint # bad
  - ValeLint # good
```

Like the other extension points, this will intelligently ignore certain syntax constructs (e.g., code blocks, URLs, etc.)
